<h1> My Personal Website üåê</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
This is a website using different elements of HTML to express different interests and information about myself. It details my favorite websites, my course schedule (at the time), my favorite foods, one of my favorite songs, and past performances I was a part of. It also features a piece of one of the digital artworks that I created a few years ago.
